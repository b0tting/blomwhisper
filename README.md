# blomwhisper
Small application for a friend, who was looking for an addition to his game costume. Used a C.H.I.P. and some additional linux configuration to set up an access point.

At times, this applicaton would play a random sounds from a given list. Using a web application you could manage the sound library runtime. This was used in the game to have a costume that would whisper at times and after meeting the wearer you might at a later time hear whispers related to you!
